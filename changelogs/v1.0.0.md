# Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

**Release Date**: January 31, 2026  
**Status**: Initial Public Release

## What This Repository Does

The **Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) Advertising** skill enables OpenClaw AI agents to autonomously discover, create, manage, and optimize advertising campaigns using natural language. Built on the Ad Context Protocol (AdCP) open standard, this skill provides a comprehensive interface for programmatic advertising automation across multiple channels.

### Core Purpose

This skill bridges the gap between AI agents and the advertising ecosystem, allowing agents to:
- Discover advertising inventory through natural language queries
- Create and manage multi-channel campaigns
- Upload and organize creative assets
- Monitor real-time campaign performance
- Optimize campaigns based on data and feedback

All through conversational commands, without requiring manual platform navigation or technical advertising expertise.
